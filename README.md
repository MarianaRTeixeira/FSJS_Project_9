# FSJS_Project_9

For this project, I create a REST API using Express. This API will provide a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses.

In this project I use: 
      - DB Browser and PostMan to test the DB and the API
      - VSCODE as an IDE 
Database Configuration:
      - Sequelize
      - Sequelize CLI
      - BCRYPTJS

To start the project, npm install and npm start
